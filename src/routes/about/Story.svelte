				Founded in 2018, our journey began with a simple question: "How can we build technology that
				truly serves humanity?" While other companies focused solely on profit, we committed to a
				different path.

			<p class="text-body">
				Our mission extends beyond creating innovative products. We're dedicated to ethical
				practices, sustainability, and ensuring our technology is accessible to all. Every decision
				we make is guided by these core principles.

			<p class="text-body">
				Since our founding, we've approached each project with the same fundamental question: how
				does this technology benefit humanity? This perspective has guided us through challenging
				decisions and shaped our company culture. We prioritize long-term positive impact over
				short-term gains.
			</p>

			<p class="text-body">
				Our dedication to ethical technology means we carefully consider the societal implications
				of our work. We believe technology should enhance human connection, protect privacy, and
				promote equality. When these values guide innovation, technology becomes a powerful force
				for good.
